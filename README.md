# VIMergency

This is a tiny vim config that aims at making vim usable on servers & machines you want to keep clean without useless stuff.

If you have root it is advised to put this file as `/etc/vim/vimrc.local` so you don't have to care about setting it for each user on the system.

Optionally you can add the OneDark theme at `$VIMRUNTIME/{autoload,colors}/onedark.vim` (To find the path, run `:!echo $VIMRUNTIME`, when root or $HOME/.vim for non-root)
